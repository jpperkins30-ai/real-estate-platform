# Filter System Test Issues Summary

## Overview
Testing the filter system revealed several issues that need to be addressed. The test failures are primarily related to:
1. Changes in the panelState storage key format
2. Incompatible function signatures in the usePanelState hook
3. Missing test files for some components

## Detailed Issues

### 1. FilterContext Tests
- **Issue**: Test failure in "loads and deletes filters correctly"
- **Error**: The filter loading mechanism is not correctly updating the UI with the loaded filter
- **Details**: When loading a saved filter, the filter state is not being correctly applied
- **Resolution needed**: Fix the `loadFilter` function to properly apply saved filters

### 2. usePanelState Hook Tests
- **Issue 1**: Storage key format mismatch
- **Error**: Expected `panel-test-panel-state` but received `panelState_test-panel`
- **Details**: The tests expect a different storage key format than what's actually used in the implementation
- **Resolution needed**: Update the tests to use the correct storage key format or adjust the implementation

- **Issue 2**: State merging not working correctly
- **Error**: Expected merged state object to include both saved and initial properties
- **Details**: When loading from storage, the initial state and saved state are not merging correctly
- **Resolution needed**: Fix the state merging logic in the usePanelState hook

- **Issue 3**: `updateProperty` function missing
- **Error**: `result.current.updateProperty is not a function`
- **Details**: The tests expect an `updateProperty` function that doesn't exist in the implementation
- **Resolution needed**: Implement the `updateProperty` function or update the tests to use the available API

### 3. Missing Test Files
- FilterService tests (`filterService.test.ts`)
- PanelState service tests (`panelStateService.test.ts`)
- FilterPanel component tests (`FilterPanel.test.tsx`)
- Integration tests for the filter system

## Next Steps

1. Fix the storage key format mismatch in panelStateService
2. Implement the missing `updateProperty` function in usePanelState
3. Fix the state merging logic in the usePanelState hook
4. Create the missing test files:
   - `filterService.test.ts`
   - `panelStateService.test.ts`
   - `FilterPanel.test.tsx`
   - `FilterSystemIntegration.test.tsx`

## Vitest Configuration Issue
- There's a TypeScript error in the Vitest configuration file related to plugin compatibility
- This appears to be a dependency version mismatch but doesn't affect the actual tests
- Consider updating the Vitest and React plugin packages to ensure compatibility
