# Documentation Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to the project documentation to align with the changes introduced in the Chunk 1 Core Container and Layout_Revised_v3 implementation guide. These updates focused on standardizing field naming, documenting component relationships, and establishing consistent test path structures.

## Key Updates

### 1. Field Naming Standardization

- **layout-api-swagger.yaml:**
  - Replaced all instances of `isGlobal` with `isDefault` and `isPublic` fields
  - Added descriptive documentation for each field to clarify their purpose
  - Maintained consistent examples throughout the API documentation

### 2. Component Inheritance and Composition

- **architecture/components.md:**
  - Added a new section "Component Inheritance and Composition" that details:
    - Component hierarchy (base and specialized components)
    - Responsibility distribution among components
    - Composition relationships between components
    - Visual diagram of component inheritance using Mermaid

### 3. Test Path Structure

- **architecture.md:**
  - Added a comprehensive testing section including:
    - Unit testing and integration testing overview
    - Standardized test path structure (using `src/_tests_/` with single underscores)
    - Test ID system with prefix format `TC{ID}`
    - Example test structure with file naming conventions
    - ID numbering system for different component types
    - Test description format incorporating TC IDs for traceability

### 4. API Standards

- **architecture.md:**
  - Added a detailed API Standards section covering:
    - Endpoint naming conventions
    - Response format standardization
    - Error handling approach
    - Field naming standards, specifically highlighting:
      - Boolean flag naming with `is` prefix
      - Field naming migration from `isGlobal` to `isDefault`/`isPublic`
      - Support for backward compatibility during transition
    - Recommendation for API versioning for significant changes

## Overall Impact

These documentation updates create a more consistent and comprehensive reference for developers working on the project. They address several issues identified in the Implementation Guide Variances report, particularly around field naming consistency, component relationships, and testing standards.

The updates also lay the groundwork for future documentation improvements by establishing clear patterns and standards that can be followed across the codebase.

## Next Steps

- Continue to apply these standardized approaches to other documentation files
- Consider adding backward compatibility handling in API implementation for the field naming changes
- Implement the suggested API versioning approach for future significant API changes
- Update any remaining references to old test path formats in other documentation files
