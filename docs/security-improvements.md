# Security Improvements

> **Note**: This document is part of the Real Estate Platform's security documentation. For a complete overview of security measures and best practices, see the [main security guide](./SECURITY.md).

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the Real Estate Platform according to the audit recommendations.

## Authentication Enhancements

### 1. JWT Secret Management

Previously, the application would fallback to a hardcoded JWT secret if none was provided through environment variables. This posed a significant security risk if the application was deployed without properly setting the JWT_SECRET.

**Improvements**:
- Removed hardcoded JWT secret fallback
- Added strict environment variable validation that exits the application if required security variables are missing
- Added separate validation for production environments

```typescript
// Ensure environment variables are set
if (!process.env.JWT_SECRET) {
  console.error('ERROR: JWT_SECRET environment variable is not set. This is a security risk.');
  process.exit(1); // Exit the process to prevent running with insecure settings
}
```

### 2. Token Refresh Mechanism

Implemented a token refresh mechanism to improve session management and security:

**Improvements**:
- Split token generation into access tokens (short-lived) and refresh tokens (long-lived)
- Created new endpoints for refreshing access tokens
- Implemented proper token verification for refresh operations
- Configured separate expiration times for access and refresh tokens

**Access Token Flow**:
1. Short-lived token (default: 15 minutes) used for API authentication
2. Contains user ID, email, and role information
3. Used for all authenticated API requests

**Refresh Token Flow**:
1. Long-lived token (default: 7 days) used only for obtaining new access tokens
2. Contains minimal information (user ID and role only)
3. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without requiring login credentials

### 3. Password Complexity Requirements

Enhanced password validation to enforce stronger passwords:

**Improvements**:
- Increased minimum password length from 6 to 8 characters
- Added complexity requirements:
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one uppercase letter 
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Implemented using express-validator middleware

```typescript
const passwordComplexityCheck = body('password')
  .isLength({ min: 8 }).withMessage('Password must be at least 8 characters long')
  .matches(/[a-z]/).withMessage('Password must contain at least one lowercase letter')
  .matches(/[A-Z]/).withMessage('Password must contain at least one uppercase letter')
  .matches(/[0-9]/).withMessage('Password must contain at least one number')
  .matches(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/).withMessage('Password must contain at least one special character');
```

## CORS Security

Implemented environment-specific CORS configuration to prevent cross-origin attacks:

**Improvements**:
- Created environment-specific CORS settings (strict for production, permissive for development)
- Added ability to configure allowed origins through environment variables
- Explicitly defined allowed methods and headers
- Set appropriate cache control with maxAge

```typescript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: isProduction 
    ? process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS ? process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(',') : 'https://yourdomain.com'
    : '*',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true,
  maxAge: 86400 // 24 hours
};
```

## Error Handling Security

Improved error handling to prevent exposing sensitive information:

**Improvements**:
- Production error responses hide implementation details
- Added error codes to authentication responses for better client handling
- Standardized error response format across the application

## Environment Variables

Updated environment variable management:

**Improvements**:
- Created comprehensive `.env.example` file with all required variables
- Added validation for required environment variables in production
- Categorized environment variables by function (server, database, auth, etc.)
- Documented each variable's purpose and format

## Required Actions for Migration

1. Update the `.env` file with the new variables:
   - `JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION` (default: 15m)
   - `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION` (default: 7d)
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (for production CORS configuration)

2. Update client applications to:
   - Store both access token and refresh token after login/registration
   - Use access token for API requests
   - When access token expires, use refresh token to obtain a new access token
   - Update authentication header to use the new token format

3. Test the refresh token flow to ensure proper expiration and renewal of sessions
