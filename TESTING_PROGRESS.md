# Testing Progress Report

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Duplicate Function Export in useResizable.ts
**Problem:** The `useResizable.ts` hook had two exported functions with the same name.
**Solution:** Removed the simpler version and kept the more complete implementation with generics that's being used in the tests.
**Files fixed:** 
- `client/src/hooks/useResizable.ts`

### 2. useDraggable Hook Issues
**Problem:** The hook wasn't properly handling cases where the parent element was null, causing reference errors.
**Solution:** Added proper null checks in the `handleMouseMove` function.
**Files fixed:** 
- `client/src/hooks/useDraggable.ts`

### 3. React Router Mocking Issues
**Problem:** Some tests were still using Jest syntax for mocking instead of Vitest.
**Solution:** Updated the React Router mocking to use proper Vitest syntax and explicitly include the `MemoryRouter` export.
**Files fixed:** 
- `client/src/components/multiframe/controllers/__tests__/ControllerWizardLauncher.test.tsx`

### 4. CountyPanel Test Issues
**Problem:** Tests were failing with "Unable to destructure property 'entityId' from useEntityData".
**Solution:** Fixed the mock implementation to always provide the `entityId` property.
**Files fixed:** 
- `client/src/__tests__/components/multiframe/panels/CountyPanel.test.tsx`

### 5. Empty Test File
**Problem:** Empty `PanelResizer.test.tsx` file was causing test failures.
**Solution:** Removed the empty file.
**Files fixed:** 
- Deleted `client/src/components/multiframe/__tests__/PanelResizer.test.tsx`

### 6. useDraggable Test Failures
**Problem:** Tests were failing with DOM event handling issues.
**Solution:** Completely rewrote the test to:
1. Mock document event listeners
2. Manually capture and invoke event handlers
3. Use `Object.defineProperty` to set readonly refs
4. Add proper TypeScript typing for handlers
**Files fixed:** 
- `client/src/__tests__/hooks/useDraggable.test.tsx`

## Remaining Issues

### 1. PropertySearchBox Test Failures
**Problem:** Tests are failing with error message expectations.
**Recommended approach:**
1. Examine the actual error messages being produced vs what's expected
2. Check the mock data structure to ensure it matches component expectations
3. Update error handling in tests to match component behavior

### 2. PanelHeader Style Tests
**Problem:** Style tests need to be updated to match component implementation.
**Recommended approach:**
1. Update test expectations to match current styles
2. Use more flexible matchers like `expect.objectContaining()`
3. Consider testing behavior rather than exact style values

### 3. EnhancedPanelContainer Test Issues
**Problem:** Multiple mock issues with imports and component rendering.
**Progress:** We've updated the mocking approach, but further testing is needed.
**Recommended approach:**
1. Run specific tests for this component
2. Resolve any remaining import issues
3. Ensure mock implementations match actual component needs

## Testing Strategy

For fixing remaining issues:

1. Run targeted tests to isolate failures:
   ```
   npm test -- PropertySearchBox
   npm test -- PanelHeader
   ```

2. Use logging in tests to see actual vs expected values:
   ```
   console.log('Actual:', actual);
   console.log('Expected:', expected);
   ```

3. When updating mocks, ensure they reflect the actual implementation:
   - Review the actual component implementation first
   - Make mocks return values in the expected format
   - Use TypeScript to enforce correct mock types

4. For DOM event testing:
   - Mock event listeners as we did with useDraggable
   - Manually trigger events rather than using dispatchEvent
   - Verify state changes after events
