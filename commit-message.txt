feat(inventory): Add property search functionality

Implement a comprehensive property search solution with both exact and fuzzy matching capabilities:

- Create PropertySearchBox component with error handling and loading states
- Integrate PropertySearchBox into CountyDetails component
- Create a dedicated PropertySearchPage with county selection
- Add propertySearch service with direct and fuzzy search functions
- Write unit tests for both the service and component
- Update the inventory module routes and navigation
- Add 'accountNumber' field to PropertyTaxStatus interface
- Update documentation to describe the property search implementation

This feature allows users to easily find properties using various identifiers 
(parcel IDs, tax account numbers) with fallback to fuzzy matching when exact 
matches are not found.
