feat(inventory): Add comprehensive data export functionality

Implement data export capabilities to enable users to download property, county, and state data:

- Create client-side export service with support for CSV, Excel, and JSON formats
- Implement server-side ExportService for data processing and format conversion
- Add RESTful API endpoints for exporting data with filtering capabilities
- Create reusable DataExportButton component with filter options modal
- Integrate export functionality in the CountyDetails view

This feature allows users to export inventory data in multiple formats with customizable
filters, making it easier to analyze data in external tools and share information with 
stakeholders. The implementation follows best practices for large data handling and 
provides a consistent user experience.
