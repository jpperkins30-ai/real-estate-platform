2. Fixed the export of the `connectDB` function to be both a named export and the default export.
3. Added better error handling in the database connection process.

## Server Configuration
1. Updated the `index.ts` file to correctly import and use the logger.
2. Fixed imports for Collection and DataSource models.
3. Added environment variable checks and improved error handling.

## Testing Setup
1. Created simplified testing scripts to verify database connectivity.
2. Set up batch files for easily running the server with the correct environment variables.
3. Added proper tsconfig.json configuration with path aliases.

## Environment Variables
1. Ensured all scripts properly set the JWT_SECRET environment variable.
2. Added clear error messages when required environment variables are missing.

## Simplified Server Alternatives
1. Created minimal server implementation for testing specific functionality.
2. Provided alternative server startup scripts for different use cases.
