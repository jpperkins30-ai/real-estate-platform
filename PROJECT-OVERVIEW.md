# Real Estate Investment Platform

## Project Overview

The Real Estate Investment Platform is a comprehensive solution for real estate investors to discover, analyze, and manage investment opportunities. The platform aggregates property data from multiple sources, standardizes it, and provides powerful search and analytics capabilities.

## System Architecture

The platform consists of several interconnected components:

### 1. Data Collection Framework

A modular system for gathering property data from various sources including:
- County tax records
- MLS listings
- Public auction sites
- Foreclosure databases

Key features:
- Pluggable collector architecture for different data sources
- Rate limiting and caching to respect API limits
- Fault tolerance with retries and error handling
- Scheduling system for regular data updates

### 2. Data Transformation Pipeline

A flexible system for standardizing property data from diverse sources:
- Standardization step for common field patterns
- Address normalization for consistent formatting
- Geocoding to add coordinates based on addresses
- Validation rules to ensure data quality

Support utilities:
- `geocoding.ts`: Converts addresses to geographical coordinates
- `fuzzyMatching.ts`: Matches similar property entries
- `logger.ts`: Provides consistent logging throughout the system

### 3. Data Storage

MongoDB database with schemas for:
- Properties: Standardized property records
- Data Sources: Configuration for data collection sources
- Projects: User-defined investment projects
- Users: Authentication and authorization

### 4. API Layer

RESTful API with endpoints for:
- Property search and filtering
- User authentication and authorization
- Project management
- Data export and reporting

### 5. Frontend Interface

React-based web application providing:
- Property search with map visualization
- Property comparison tools
- Investment analysis calculators
- Project management dashboard

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

The PoC demonstrates the core data collection and transformation capabilities of the platform. It includes:

1. A sample data collector for St. Mary's County, Maryland property tax records
2. The data transformation pipeline for standardizing collected data
3. A simple script to run the collection and transformation process

### Running the PoC

To execute the Proof of Concept, run:

```bash
./run-poc.sh
```

This will:
1. Collect sample property data from the St. Mary's County source
2. Process the data through the transformation pipeline
3. Save the standardized data to the output directory

### Output Structure

The PoC generates output in the following directories:
- `data/raw`: Raw data collected from sources
- `data/processed`: Standardized property data
- `data/errors`: Error logs for failed transformations

## Next Steps

Future development will focus on:

1. Expanding the collector framework to support more data sources
2. Enhancing the transformation pipeline with additional enrichment steps
3. Implementing the MongoDB persistence layer
4. Developing the RESTful API
5. Creating the frontend interface
