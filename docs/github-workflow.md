# GitHub Workflow Guide

## Repository Setup

### Initial Setup
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Clone the repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-platform.git
cd real-estate-platform
```

### Branch Structure
```
main (production)
├── staging
└── development
    ├── feature/user-auth
    ├── feature/property-search
    └── bugfix/login-issue
```

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation
- `docs/*`: Documentation updates

### Creating a New Branch
```bash
# For a new feature
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/property-search

# For a bug fix
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b bugfix/login-issue
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Daily Workflow
```bash
# Start your day by updating your branch
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout your-branch
git merge development

# Work on your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add property search functionality"
git push origin your-branch
```

### 2. Commit Message Convention
```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(search): add property filtering by price range

- Implement price range slider
- Add filter validation
- Update API endpoint

Closes #123"
```

### 3. Pull Request Process
1. Create PR from your branch to development
2. Fill out PR template
3. Request reviews
4. Address feedback
5. Merge after approval

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Merge Conflicts**

git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin your-branch
```

2. **Reverting Changes**
```bash
# Revert last commit
git revert HEAD

# Revert specific commit
git revert commit-hash

# Reset to specific commit
git reset --hard commit-hash
```

3. **Branch Management**
```bash
# List branches
git branch -a

# Delete local branch
git branch -d branch-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name

# Clean up local references
git remote prune origin
```

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Management**
   - Keep branches short-lived
   - Regular rebasing with development
   - Delete merged branches
   - Use meaningful branch names

2. **Commits**
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Make atomic commits
   - Reference issues in commits
   - Sign your commits

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Keep PRs focused and small
   - Provide clear descriptions
   - Include tests
   - Link related issues

4. **Code Review**
   - Review promptly
   - Be constructive
   - Check for security issues
   - Verify documentation
